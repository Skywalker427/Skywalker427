Hello there! I'm Junaid, a passionate backend engineer with a flair for artificial intelligence and machine vision. With a solid foundation in TypeScript, Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, and AWS, I bring robust solutions to life. I hold a Masters's degree in Artificial Intelligence, and I'm excited to combine my technical skills with my AI expertise to create innovative and efficient systems.

## What I Do

- **Backend Engineering:** I specialize in designing, developing and maintaining scalable backend solutions that power applications with high performance and reliability.

- **AI and Machine Vision:** My journey through the world of AI has led me to explore the realms of training machine vision models and diving deep into the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like never before.
